# This metaclass is all about one thing - lazily resolving the media files.
#
# All the CSS/JS/HTML associated with a component - e.g. the `js`, `js_file`, `template_file` or `Media` class,
# are all class attributes. And some of these attributes need to be resolved, e.g. to find the files
# that `js_file`, `css_file` and `template_file` point to.
#
# Some of the resolutions we need to do is:
# - Component's HTML/JS/CSS files can be defined as relative to the component class file. So for each file,
#   we check the relative path points to an actual file, and if so, we use that path.
# - If the component defines `js_file` or `css_file`, we load the content of the file and set it to `js` or `css`.
#   - Note 1: These file paths still may be relative to the component, so the paths are resolved as above,
#             before we load the content.
#   - Note 2: We don't support both `js` and `js_file` being set at the same time.
#
# At the same time, we need to do so lazily, otherwise we hit a problem with circular imports when trying to
# use Django settings. This is because the settings are not available at the time when the component class is defined
# (Assuming that components are defined at the top-level of modules).
#
# We achieve this by:
# 1. At class creation, we define a private `ComponentMedia` object that holds all the media-related attributes.
# 2. At the same time, we replace the actual media-related attributes (like `js`) with descriptors that intercept
#    the access to them.
# 3. When the user tries to access the media-related attributes, we resolve the media files if they haven't been
#    resolved yet.
# 4. Any further access to the media-related attributes will return the resolved values.

    Resolve the media files associated with the component.

    ### 1. Media are resolved relative to class definition file

    E.g. if in a directory `my_comp` you have `script.js` and `my_comp.py`,
    and `my_comp.py` looks like this:

    ```py
    class MyComponent(Component):
        class Media:
            js = "script.js"
    ```

    Then `script.js` will be understood as relative to the component file.
    To obtain the final path, we make it relative to a component directory (as set in `COMPONENTS.dirs`
    and `COMPONENTS.app_dirs`; and `STATICFILES_DIRS` for JS and CSS). So if the parent directory is `components/`,
    and the component file is inside `components/my_comp/my_comp.py`, then the final path will be relative
    to `components/`, thus `./my_comp/script.js`.

    If the relative path does not point to an actual file, the path is kept as is.

    Resolve the `Media` class associated with the component.

    We support following cases:

    1. As plain strings
        ```py

            class Media:
                js = "path/to/script.js"
                css = "path/to/style.css"
        ```

    2. As lists
        ```py
        class MyComponent(Component):
            class Media:
                js = ["path/to/script1.js", "path/to/script2.js"]
                css = ["path/to/style1.css", "path/to/style2.css"]
        ```

    3. [CSS ONLY] Dicts of strings
        ```py
        class MyComponent(Component):
