# Release notes

## v0.130

#### Feat

- Access the HttpRequest object under `Component.request`.

    To pass the request object to a component, either:
    - Render a template or component with `RequestContext`,
    - Or set the `request` kwarg to `Component.render()` or `Component.render_to_response()`.

    Read more on [HttpRequest](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.130/concepts/fundamentals/http_request/).

- Access the context processors data under `Component.context_processors_data`.

    Context processors data is available only when the component has access to the `request` object,
    either by:
    - Passing the request to `Component.render()` or `Component.render_to_response()`,
    - Or by rendering a template or component with `RequestContext`,
    - Or being nested in another component that has access to the request object.

    The data from context processors is automatically available within the component's template.

## v0.129

#### Fix

- Fix thread unsafe media resolve validation by moving it to ComponentMedia `__post_init` ([#977](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/977)
- Fix bug: Relative path in extends and include does not work when using template_file ([#976](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/976)
- Fix error when template cache setting (`template_cache_size`) is set to 0 ([#974](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/974)

## v0.128

#### Feat

- Configurable cache - Set [`COMPONENTS.cache`](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.128/reference/settings/#django_components.app_settings.ComponentsSettings.cache) to change where and how django-components caches JS and CSS files. ([#946](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/946))

    Read more on [Caching](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.128/guides/setup/caching).

- Highlight coponents and slots in the UI - We've added two boolean settings [`COMPONENTS.debug_highlight_components`](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.128/reference/settings/#django_components.app_settings.ComponentsSettings.debug_highlight_components) and [`COMPONENTS.debug_highlight_slots`](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.128/reference/settings/#django_components.app_settings.ComponentsSettings.debug_highlight_slots), which can be independently set to `True`. First will wrap components in a blue border, the second will wrap slots in a red border. ([#942](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/942))

    Read more on [Troubleshooting](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.128/guides/other/troubleshooting/#component-and-slot-highlighting).

#### Refactor

- Removed use of eval for node validation ([#944](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/944))

#### Perf

- Components can now be infinitely nested. ([#936](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/936))

- Component input validation is now 6-7x faster on CPython and PyPy. This previously made up 10-30% of the total render time. ([#945](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/945))

## v0.127

#### Fix

- Fix component rendering when using `{% cache %}` with remote cache and multiple web servers ([#930](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/930))

## v0.126

#### Refactor

- Replaced [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) with a custom HTML parser.
- The heuristic for inserting JS and CSS dependenies into the default place has changed.
    - JS is still inserted at the end of the `<body>`, and CSS at the end of `<head>`.
    - However, we find end of `<body>` by searching for **last** occurrence of `</body>`
    - And for the end of `<head>` we search for the **first** occurrence of `</head>`

## v0.125

⚠️ Attention ⚠️ - We migrated from `EmilStenstrom/django-components` to `django-components/django-components`.

**Repo name and documentation URL changed. Package name remains the same.**

If you see any broken links or other issues, please report them in [#922](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/922).

#### Feat

- `@template_tag` and `BaseNode` - A decorator and a class that allow you to define
  custom template tags that will behave similarly to django-components' own template tags.

  Read more on [Template tags](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.125/concepts/advanced/template_tags/).

  Template tags defined with `@template_tag` and `BaseNode` will have the following features:

  - Accepting args, kwargs, and flags.

  - Allowing literal lists and dicts as inputs as:
  
     `key=[1, 2, 3]` or `key={"a": 1, "b": 2}`
  - Using template tags tag inputs as:
  
    `{% my_tag key="{% lorem 3 w %}" / %}`
  - Supporting the flat dictionary definition:
  
     `attr:key=value`
  - Spreading args and kwargs with `...`:
  
     `{% my_tag ...args ...kwargs / %}`
  - Being able to call the template tag as:
  
     `{% my_tag %} ... {% endmy_tag %}` or `{% my_tag / %}`


#### Refactor

- Refactored template tag input validation. When you now call template tags like
  `{% slot %}`, `{% fill %}`, `{% html_attrs %}`, and others, their inputs are now
  validated the same way as Python function inputs are.

    So, for example

    ```django
    {% slot "my_slot" name="content" / %}
    ```

    will raise an error, because the positional argument `name` is given twice.

    NOTE: Special kwargs whose keys are not valid Python variable names are not affected by this change.
    So when you define:

    ```django
    {% component data-id=123 / %}
    ```

    The `data-id` will still be accepted as a valid kwarg, assuming that your `get_context_data()`
    accepts `**kwargs`:

    ```py
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        return {
            "data_id": kwargs["data-id"],
        }
    ```

## v0.124

#### Feat

- Instead of inlining the JS and CSS under `Component.js` and `Component.css`, you can move
    them to their own files, and link the JS/CSS files with `Component.js_file`  and `Component.css_file`.

    Even when you specify the JS/CSS with `Component.js_file` or `Component.css_file`, then you can still
    access the content under `Component.js` or `Component.css` - behind the scenes, the content of the JS/CSS files
    will be set to `Component.js` / `Component.css` upon first access.

    The same applies to `Component.template_file`, which will populate `Component.template` upon first access.

    With this change, the role of `Component.js/css` and the JS/CSS in `Component.Media` has changed:

    - The JS/CSS defined in `Component.js/css` or `Component.js/css_file` is the "main" JS/CSS
    - The JS/CSS defined in `Component.Media.js/css` are secondary or additional

    See the updated ["Getting Started" tutorial](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.124/getting_started/adding_js_and_css/)

#### Refactor

- The canonical way to define a template file was changed from `template_name` to `template_file`, to align with the rest of the API.
  
    `template_name` remains for backwards compatibility. When you get / set `template_name`,
    internally this is proxied to `template_file`.

- The undocumented `Component.component_id` was removed. Instead, use `Component.id`. Changes:

    - While `component_id` was unique every time you instantiated `Component`, the new `id` is unique
    every time you render the component (e.g. with `Component.render()`)
    - The new `id` is available only during render, so e.g. from within `get_context_data()`

- Component's HTML / CSS / JS are now resolved and loaded lazily. That is, if you specify `template_name`/`template_file`,
  `js_file`, `css_file`, or `Media.js/css`, the file paths will be resolved only once you:
  
    1. Try to access component's HTML / CSS / JS, or
    2. Render the component.

    Read more on [Accessing component's HTML / JS / CSS](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/0.124/concepts/fundamentals/defining_js_css_html_files/#customize-how-paths-are-rendered-into-html-tags).

- Component inheritance:

    - When you subclass a component, the JS and CSS defined on parent's `Media` class is now inherited by the child component.
    - You can disable or customize Media inheritance by setting `extend` attribute on the `Component.Media` nested class. This work similarly to Django's [`Media.extend`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/forms/media/#extend).
    - When child component defines either `template` or `template_file`, both of parent's `template` and `template_file` are ignored. The same applies to `js_file` and `css_file`.

- Autodiscovery now ignores files and directories that start with an underscore (`_`), except `__init__.py`

- The [Signals](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/signals/) emitted by or during the use of django-components are now documented, together the `template_rendered` signal.

## v0.123

#### Fix

- Fix edge cases around rendering components whose templates used the `{% extends %}` template tag ([#859](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/859))

## v0.122

#### Feat

- Add support for HTML fragments. HTML fragments can be rendered by passing `type="fragment"` to `Component.render()` or `Component.render_to_response()`. Read more on how to [use HTML fragments with HTMX, AlpineJS, or vanillaJS](https://django-components.github.io/django-components/latest/concepts/advanced/html_tragments).

## v0.121

#### Fix

- Fix the use of Django template filters (`|lower:"etc"`) with component inputs [#855](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/855).

## v0.120

⚠️ Attention ⚠️ - Please update to v0.121 to fix bugs introduced in v0.119.

#### Fix

- Fix the use of translation strings `_("bla")` as inputs to components [#849](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/849).

## v0.119

⚠️ Attention ⚠️ - This release introduced bugs [#849](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/849), [#855](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/855). Please update to v0.121.

#### Fix

- Fix compatibility with custom subclasses of Django's `Template` that need to access
  `origin` or other initialization arguments. (https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/828)

#### Refactor

- Compatibility with `django-debug-toolbar-template-profiler`:
  - Monkeypatching of Django's `Template` now happens at `AppConfig.ready()` (https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/825)

- Internal parsing of template tags tag was updated. No API change. (https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/827)

## v0.118

#### Feat

- Add support for `context_processors` and `RenderContext` inside component templates

   `Component.render()` and `Component.render_to_response()` now accept an extra kwarg `request`.

    ```py
    def my_view(request)
        return MyTable.render_to_response(
            request=request
        )
    ```

   - When you pass in `request`, the component will use `RenderContext` instead of `Context`.
    Thus the context processors will be applied to the context.

   - NOTE: When you pass in both `request` and `context` to `Component.render()`, and `context` is already an instance of `Context`, the `request` kwarg will be ignored.

## v0.117

#### Fix

- The HTML parser no longer erronously inserts `<html><head><body>` on some occasions, and
  no longer tries to close unclosed HTML tags.

#### Refactor

- Replaced [Selectolax](https://github.com/rushter/selectolax) with [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) as project dependencies.

## v0.116

⚠️ Attention ⚠️ - Please update to v0.117 to fix known bugs. See [#791](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/791) and [#789](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/789) and [#818](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/818).

#### Fix

- Fix the order of execution of JS scripts:
  - Scripts in `Component.Media.js` are executed in the order they are defined
  - Scripts in `Component.js` are executed AFTER `Media.js` scripts

- Fix compatibility with AlpineJS
  - Scripts in `Component.Media.js` are now again inserted as `<script>` tags
  - By default, `Component.Media.js` are inserted as synchronous `<script>` tags,
    so the AlpineJS components registered in the `Media.js` scripts will now again
    run BEFORE the core AlpineJS script.

  AlpineJS can be configured like so:

  Option 1 - AlpineJS loaded in `<head>` with `defer` attribute:
  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      {% component_css_dependencies %}
      <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      {% component 'my_alpine_component' / %}
      {% component_js_dependencies %}
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  Option 2 - AlpineJS loaded in `<body>` AFTER `{% component_js_depenencies %}`:
  ```html
  <html>
      <head>
          {% component_css_dependencies %}
      </head>
      <body>
          {% component 'my_alpine_component' / %}
          {% component_js_dependencies %}

          <script src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs"></script>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

## 🚨📢 v0.110

⚠️ Attention ⚠️ - Please update to v0.117 to fix known bugs. See [#791](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/791) and [#789](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/789) and [#818](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/818).

### General

#### 🚨📢 BREAKING CHANGES

- Installation changes:

    - If your components include JS or CSS, you now must use the middleware and add django-components' URLs to your `urlpatterns`
    (See "[Adding support for JS and CSS](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#adding-support-for-js-and-css)")

- Component typing signature changed from

    ```py
    Component[Args, Kwargs, Data, Slots]
    ```

    to

    ```py
    Component[Args, Kwargs, Slots, Data, JsData, CssData]
    ```

- If you rendered a component A with `Component.render()` and then inserted that into another component B, now you must pass `render_dependencies=False` to component A:

    ```py
    prerendered_a = CompA.render(
        args=[...],
        kwargs={...},
        render_dependencies=False,
    )

    html = CompB.render(
        kwargs={
            content=prerendered_a,
        },
    )
    ```

#### Feat

- Intellisense and mypy validation for settings:
  
  Instead of defining the `COMPONENTS` settings as a plain dict, you can use `ComponentsSettings`:

  ```py
  # settings.py
  from django_components import ComponentsSettings

  COMPONENTS = ComponentsSettings(
      autodiscover=True,
      ...
  )
  ```

- Use `get_component_dirs()` and `get_component_files()` to get the same list of dirs / files that would be imported by `autodiscover()`, but without actually
importing them.

#### Refactor

- For advanced use cases, use can omit the middleware and instead manage component JS and CSS dependencies yourself with [`render_dependencies`](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#render_dependencies-and-deep-dive-into-rendering-js--css-without-the-middleware)

- The [`ComponentRegistry`](../api#django_components.ComponentRegistry) settings [`RegistrySettings`](../api#django_components.RegistrySettings)
  were lowercased to align with the global settings:
  - `RegistrySettings.CONTEXT_BEHAVIOR` -> `RegistrySettings.context_behavior`
  - `RegistrySettings.TAG_FORMATTER` -> `RegistrySettings.tag_formatter`

  The old uppercase settings `CONTEXT_BEHAVIOR` and `TAG_FORMATTER` are deprecated and will be removed in v1.

- The setting `reload_on_template_change` was renamed to
  [`reload_on_file_change`](../settings#django_components.app_settings.ComponentsSettings#reload_on_file_change).
  And now it properly triggers server reload when any file in the component dirs change. The old name `reload_on_template_change`
  is deprecated and will be removed in v1.

- The setting `forbidden_static_files` was renamed to
  [`static_files_forbidden`](../settings#django_components.app_settings.ComponentsSettings#static_files_forbidden)
  to align with [`static_files_allowed`](../settings#django_components.app_settings.ComponentsSettings#static_files_allowed)
  The old name `forbidden_static_files` is deprecated and will be removed in v1.

### Tags

#### 🚨📢 BREAKING CHANGES

- `{% component_dependencies %}` tag was removed. Instead, use `{% component_js_dependencies %}` and `{% component_css_dependencies %}`

    - The combined tag was removed to encourage the best practice of putting JS scripts at the end of `<body>`, and CSS styles inside `<head>`.

        On the other hand, co-locating JS script and CSS styles can lead to
        a [flash of unstyled content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content),
        as either JS scripts will block the rendering, or CSS will load too late.

- The undocumented keyword arg `preload` of `{% component_js_dependencies %}` and `{% component_css_dependencies %}` tags was removed.
  This will be replaced with HTML fragment support.

#### Fix

- Allow using forward slash (`/`) when defining custom TagFormatter,
  e.g. `{% MyComp %}..{% /MyComp %}`.

#### Refactor

- `{% component_dependencies %}` tags are now OPTIONAL - If your components use JS and CSS, but you don't use `{% component_dependencies %}` tags, the JS and CSS will now be, by default, inserted at the end of `<body>` and at the end of `<head>` respectively.

### Slots

#### Feat

- Fills can now be defined within loops (`{% for %}`) or other tags (like `{% with %}`),
  or even other templates using `{% include %}`.
  
  Following is now possible

  ```django
  {% component "table" %}
    {% for slot_name in slots %}
      {% fill name=slot_name %}
      {% endfill %}
    {% endfor %}
  {% endcomponent %}
  ```

- If you need to access the data or the default content of a default fill, you can
  set the `name` kwarg to `"default"`.

  Previously, a default fill would be defined simply by omitting the `{% fill %}` tags:

  ```django
  {% component "child" %}
    Hello world
  {% endcomponent %}
  ```

  But in that case you could not access the slot data or the default content, like it's possible
  for named fills:
  
  ```django
  {% component "child" %}
    {% fill name="header" data="data" %}
      Hello {{ data.user.name }}
    {% endfill %}
  {% endcomponent %}
  ```

  Now, you can specify default tag by using `name="default"`:

  ```django
  {% component "child" %}
    {% fill name="default" data="data" %}
      Hello {{ data.user.name }}
    {% endfill %}
  {% endcomponent %}
  ```

- When inside `get_context_data()` or other component methods, the default fill
  can now be accessed as `Component.input.slots["default"]`, e.g.:

  ```py
  class MyTable(Component):
      def get_context_data(self, *args, **kwargs):
          default_slot = self.input.slots["default"]
          ...
  ```

- You can now dynamically pass all slots to a child component. This is similar to
  [passing all slots in Vue](https://vue-land.github.io/faq/forwarding-slots#passing-all-slots):

  ```py
  class MyTable(Component):
      def get_context_data(self, *args, **kwargs):
          return {
              "slots": self.input.slots,
          }

      template: """
        <div>
          {% component "child" %}
            {% for slot_name in slots %}
              {% fill name=slot_name data="data" %}
                {% slot name=slot_name ...data / %}
              {% endfill %}
            {% endfor %}
          {% endcomponent %}
        </div>
      """
  ```

#### Fix

- Slots defined with `{% fill %}` tags are now properly accessible via `self.input.slots` in `get_context_data()`

- Do not raise error if multiple slots with same name are flagged as default

- Slots can now be defined within loops (`{% for %}`) or other tags (like `{% with %}`),
  or even other templates using `{% include %}`.
  
  Previously, following would cause the kwarg `name` to be an empty string:

  ```django
  {% for slot_name in slots %}
    {% slot name=slot_name %}
  {% endfor %}
  ```

#### Refactor

- When you define multiple slots with the same name inside a template,
  you now have to set the `default` and `required` flags individually.
  
  ```htmldjango
  <div class="calendar-component">
      <div class="header">
          {% slot "image" default required %}Image here{% endslot %}
      </div>
      <div class="body">
          {% slot "image" default required %}Image here{% endslot %}
      </div>
  </div>
  ```
  
  This means you can also have multiple slots with the same name but
  different conditions.

  E.g. in this example, we have a component that renders a user avatar
  - a small circular image with a profile picture of name initials.

  If the component is given `image_src` or `name_initials` variables,
  the `image` slot is optional. But if neither of those are provided,
  you MUST fill the `image` slot.

  ```htmldjango
  <div class="avatar">
      {% if image_src %}
          {% slot "image" default %}
              <img src="{{ image_src }}" />
          {% endslot %}
      {% elif name_initials %}
          {% slot "image" default required %}
              <div style="
                  border-radius: 25px;
                  width: 50px;
                  height: 50px;
                  background: blue;
              ">
                  {{ name_initials }}
              </div>
          {% endslot %}
      {% else %}
          {% slot "image" default required / %}
      {% endif %}
  </div>
  ```

- The slot fills that were passed to a component and which can be accessed as `Component.input.slots`
  can now be passed through the Django template, e.g. as inputs to other tags.

  Internally, django-components handles slot fills as functions.

  Previously, if you tried to pass a slot fill within a template, Django would try to call it as a function.

  Now, something like this is possible:

  ```py
  class MyTable(Component):
      def get_context_data(self, *args, **kwargs):
          return {
              "child_slot": self.input.slots["child_slot"],
          }

      template: """
        <div>
          {% component "child" content=child_slot / %}
        </div>
      """
  ```

  NOTE: Using `{% slot %}` and `{% fill %}` tags is still the preferred method, but the approach above
  may be necessary in some complex or edge cases.

- The `is_filled` variable (and the `{{ component_vars.is_filled }}` context variable) now returns
  `False` when you try to access a slot name which has not been defined:

  Before:

  ```django
  {{ component_vars.is_filled.header }} -> True
  {{ component_vars.is_filled.footer }} -> False
  {{ component_vars.is_filled.nonexist }} -> "" (empty string)
  ```

  After:
  ```django
  {{ component_vars.is_filled.header }} -> True
  {{ component_vars.is_filled.footer }} -> False
  {{ component_vars.is_filled.nonexist }} -> False
  ```

- Components no longer raise an error if there are extra slot fills

- Components will raise error when a slot is doubly-filled. 

  E.g. if we have a component with a default slot:

  ```django
  {% slot name="content" default / %}
  ```

  Now there is two ways how we can target this slot: Either using `name="default"`
  or `name="content"`.

  In case you specify BOTH, the component will raise an error:

  ```django
  {% component "child" %}
    {% fill slot="default" %}
      Hello from default slot
    {% endfill %}
    {% fill slot="content" data="data" %}
      Hello from content slot
    {% endfill %}
  {% endcomponent %}
  ```

## 🚨📢 v0.100

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `django_components.safer_staticfiles` app was removed. It is no longer needed.

- Installation changes:

    - Instead of defining component directories in `STATICFILES_DIRS`, set them to [`COMPONENTS.dirs`](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#dirs).
    - You now must define `STATICFILES_FINDERS`

    - [See here how to migrate your settings.py](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/blob/master/docs/migrating_from_safer_staticfiles.md)

#### Feat

- Beside the top-level `/components` directory, you can now define also app-level components dirs, e.g. `[app]/components`
  (See [`COMPONENTS.app_dirs`](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#app_dirs)).

#### Refactor

- When you call `as_view()` on a component instance, that instance will be passed to `View.as_view()`

## v0.97

#### Fix

- Fixed template caching. You can now also manually create cached templates with [`cached_template()`](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#template_cache_size---tune-the-template-cache)

#### Refactor

- The previously undocumented `get_template` was made private.

- In it's place, there's a new `get_template`, which supersedes `get_template_string` (will be removed in v1). The new `get_template` is the same as `get_template_string`, except
  it allows to return either a string or a Template instance.

- You now must use only one of `template`, `get_template`, `template_name`, or `get_template_name`.

## v0.96

#### Feat

- Run-time type validation for Python 3.11+ - If the `Component` class is typed, e.g. `Component[Args, Kwargs, ...]`, the args, kwargs, slots, and data are validated against the given types. (See [Runtime input validation with types](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#runtime-input-validation-with-types))

- Render hooks - Set `on_render_before` and `on_render_after` methods on `Component` to intercept or modify the template or context before rendering, or the rendered result afterwards. (See [Component hooks](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#component-hooks))

- `component_vars.is_filled` context variable can be accessed from within `on_render_before` and `on_render_after` hooks as `self.is_filled.my_slot`

## 0.95

#### Feat

- Added support for dynamic components, where the component name is passed as a variable. (See [Dynamic components](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#dynamic-components))

#### Refactor

- Changed `Component.input` to raise `RuntimeError` if accessed outside of render context. Previously it returned `None` if unset.

## v0.94

#### Feat

- django_components now automatically configures Django to support multi-line tags. (See [Multi-line tags](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#multi-line-tags))

- New setting `reload_on_template_change`. Set this to `True` to reload the dev server on changes to component template files. (See [Reload dev server on component file changes](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#reload-dev-server-on-component-file-changes))

## v0.93

#### Feat

- Spread operator `...dict` inside template tags. (See [Spread operator](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#spread-operator))

- Use template tags inside string literals in component inputs. (See [Use template tags inside component inputs](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#use-template-tags-inside-component-inputs))

- Dynamic slots, fills and provides - The `name` argument for these can now be a variable, a template expression, or via spread operator

- Component library authors can now configure `CONTEXT_BEHAVIOR` and `TAG_FORMATTER` settings independently from user settings.

## 🚨📢 v0.92

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `Component` class is no longer a subclass of `View`. To configure the `View` class, set the `Component.View` nested class. HTTP methods like `get` or `post` can still be defined directly on `Component` class, and `Component.as_view()` internally calls `Component.View.as_view()`. (See [Modifying the View class](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#modifying-the-view-class))

#### Feat

- The inputs (args, kwargs, slots, context, ...) that you pass to `Component.render()` can be accessed from within `get_context_data`, `get_template` and `get_template_name` via `self.input`. (See [Accessing data passed to the component](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#accessing-data-passed-to-the-component))

- Typing: `Component` class supports generics that specify types for `Component.render` (See [Adding type hints with Generics](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#adding-type-hints-with-generics))

## v0.90

#### Feat

- All tags (`component`, `slot`, `fill`, ...) now support "self-closing" or "inline" form, where you can omit the closing tag:

    ```django
    {# Before #}
    {% component "button" %}{% endcomponent %}
    {# After #}
    {% component "button" / %}
    ```

- All tags now support the "dictionary key" or "aggregate" syntax (`kwarg:key=val`):

    ```django
    {% component "button" attrs:class="hidden" %}
    ```

- You can change how the components are written in the template with [TagFormatter](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#customizing-component-tags-with-tagformatter).

    The default is `django_components.component_formatter`:

    ```django
    {% component "button" href="..." disabled %}
        Click me!
    {% endcomponent %}
    ```

    While `django_components.shorthand_component_formatter` allows you to write components like so:

    ```django
    {% button href="..." disabled %}
        Click me!
    {% endbutton %}
    ```

## 🚨📢 v0.85

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Autodiscovery module resolution changed. Following undocumented behavior was removed:

    - Previously, autodiscovery also imported any `[app]/components.py` files, and used `SETTINGS_MODULE` to search for component dirs.

        To migrate from:

        - `[app]/components.py` - Define each module in `COMPONENTS.libraries` setting,
            or import each module inside the `AppConfig.ready()` hook in respective `apps.py` files.

        - `SETTINGS_MODULE` - Define component dirs using `STATICFILES_DIRS`

    - Previously, autodiscovery handled relative files in `STATICFILES_DIRS`. To align with Django, `STATICFILES_DIRS` now must be full paths ([Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#std-setting-STATICFILES_DIRS)).

## 🚨📢 v0.81

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- The order of arguments to `render_to_response` has changed, to align with the (now public) `render` method of `Component` class.

#### Feat

- `Component.render()` is public and documented

- Slots passed `render_to_response` and `render` can now be rendered also as functions.

## v0.80

#### Feat

- Vue-like provide/inject with the `{% provide %}` tag and `inject()` method.

## 🚨📢 v0.79

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Default value for the `COMPONENTS.context_behavior` setting was changes from `"isolated"` to `"django"`. If you did not set this value explicitly before, this may be a breaking change. See the rationale for change [here](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/498).

## 🚨📢 v0.77

#### BREAKING

- The syntax for accessing default slot content has changed from

    ```django
    {% fill "my_slot" as "alias" %}
        {{ alias.default }}
    {% endfill %}

    ```

    to

    ```django
    {% fill "my_slot" default="alias" %}
        {{ alias }}
    {% endfill %}
    ```

## v0.74

#### Feat

- `{% html_attrs %}` tag for formatting data as HTML attributes

- `prefix:key=val` construct for passing dicts to components

## 🚨📢 v0.70

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `{% if_filled "my_slot" %}` tags were replaced with `{{ component_vars.is_filled.my_slot }}` variables.

- Simplified settings - `slot_context_behavior` and `context_behavior` were merged. See the [documentation](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#context-behavior) for more details.

## v0.67

#### Refactor

- Changed the default way how context variables are resolved in slots. See the [documentation](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/tree/0.67#isolate-components-slots) for more details.

## 🚨📢 v0.50

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `{% component_block %}` is now `{% component %}`, and `{% component %}` blocks need an ending `{% endcomponent %}` tag.

    The new `python manage.py upgradecomponent` command can be used to upgrade a directory (use `--path` argument to point to each dir) of templates that use components to the new syntax automatically.

    This change is done to simplify the API in anticipation of a 1.0 release of django_components. After 1.0 we intend to be stricter with big changes like this in point releases.

## v0.34

#### Feat

- Components as views, which allows you to handle requests and render responses from within a component. See the [documentation](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#use-components-as-views) for more details.

## v0.28

#### Feat

- 'implicit' slot filling and the `default` option for `slot` tags.

## v0.27

#### Feat

- A second installable app `django_components.safer_staticfiles`. It provides the same behavior as `django.contrib.staticfiles` but with extra security guarantees (more info below in [Security Notes](https://github.com/django-components/django-components#security-notes)).

## 🚨📢 v0.26

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Changed the syntax for `{% slot %}` tags. From now on, we separate defining a slot (`{% slot %}`) from filling a slot with content (`{% fill %}`). This means you will likely need to change a lot of slot tags to fill.

    We understand this is annoying, but it's the only way we can get support for nested slots that fill in other slots, which is a very nice feature to have access to. Hoping that this will feel worth it!

## v0.22

#### Feat

- All files inside components subdirectores are autoimported to simplify setup.

    An existing project might start to get `AlreadyRegistered` errors because of this. To solve this, either remove your custom loading of components, or set `"autodiscover": False` in `settings.COMPONENTS`.

## v0.17

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- Renamed `Component.context` and `Component.template` to `get_context_data` and `get_template_name`. The old methods still work, but emit a deprecation warning.

    This change was done to sync naming with Django's class based views, and make using django-components more familiar to Django users. `Component.context` and `Component.template` will be removed when version 1.0 is released.
