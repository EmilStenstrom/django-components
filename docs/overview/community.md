## Community examples

One of our goals with `django-components` is to make it easy to share components between projects
([see how to package components](../concepts/advanced/authoring_component_libraries.md)).
If you have a set of components that you think would be useful to others, please open a pull request to add them to the list below.

- [django-htmx-components](https://github.com/iwanalabs/django-htmx-components): A set of components for use with [htmx](https://htmx.org/). Try out the [live demo](https://dhc.iwanalabs.com/).

- [djc-heroicons](https://pypi.org/project/djc-heroicons/): A component that renders icons from [Heroicons.com](https://heroicons.com/).
